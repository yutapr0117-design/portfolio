Check inventory (Check 45 enforces sync with the `# \u2500\u2500 N.` sections in run()):
  48. Playwright baseline-commit pipeline permission coupling: if
      update-playwright-snapshots.yml contains the pull-request-creation step (the action
      that commits the generated baseline PNGs via a PR), then the workflow must also declare
      both `contents: write` (to push the baseline branch) and `pull-requests: write` (to open
      the PR). These two facts live in the same file but in different sections — the
      permissions block near the top and the PR step near the bottom — so they can drift
      apart silently. If a later edit trimmed the permissions back to read-only while leaving
      the PR step in place (for example by copying from the read-only regression workflow),
      the step would fail at *runtime* with a confusing permissions error and nothing would
      catch it beforehand. This check converts that latent runtime failure into an immediate
      pre-commit error, in the same spirit as the Check 29 env-signal linkage. (BLOCKING)
  49. index.html JSON-LD worksFor ↔ Organization linkage integrity: the entity-linkage
      strategy that connects the Person to the established employer organization only works
      if three facts inside the first JSON-LD @graph stay in agreement — the Person node
      carries a worksFor whose (possibly nested) reference points at the organization's
      canonical @id, AND an Organization node with that exact @id actually exists as a sibling
      in the same @graph. Because the site is served statically and consumed by knowledge-graph
      engines, a dangling reference is a *silent* failure: a worksFor pointing at an @id that
      no node defines simply fails to resolve the employment edge, so the whole "link the
      person to a strongly-established entity" strategy quietly collapses while the page still
      looks fine. If a future edit renamed the organization @id without updating the Person's
      worksFor (or deleted the Organization node but left the reference), this check fails at
      pre-commit time rather than letting the broken linkage ship. It also confirms the first
      JSON-LD block parses as valid JSON. Same cross-reference-integrity spirit as Check 47
      (import/export bijection) and Check 48 (permission coupling). (BLOCKING)
  50. ESLint flat-config migration integrity: the lint toolchain has migrated off the
      End-of-Life ESLint 8.x / eslintrc format onto flat config (introduced as default in 9.x;
      now pinned at v10). Two facts must
      stay true for that migration to remain intact. First, eslint.config.mjs (the flat config)
      must exist at the repository root — it is the sole config ESLint 9.x auto-discovers, and
      deleting it would make every lint run fall back to "no configuration" and pass vacuously.
      Second, the package.json `lint` script must NOT carry the legacy eslintrc-era flags
      (`--no-eslintrc`, `--config .eslintrc.json`, `--env`): ESLint 9.x removed those flags, so
      their presence would make `npm run lint` exit 2 (config/flag error) — and the historical
      vacuous-gate incident showed exactly how a flag mismatch can be silently swallowed. The
      legacy `.eslintrc.json` must also be absent (its lingering presence would invite a
      regression back onto the EOL format). Finally (50d), the flat config must carry the
      `no-dupe-keys` bug-catching rule: it was added after a real bug where js/quiz-renderer.js
      passed two `class` keys to the same h() props object, silently dropping the first
      (`quiz-content-line[ is-label]`) styling. The rule's silent removal from the config would
      re-open that whole class of accident, so its presence is itself machine-enforced. This
      check converts a silent reversion to the EOL linter (or loss of the dupe-key guard) into an
      immediate pre-commit error, in the same discover→systematize spirit that added Checks
      46–49. (BLOCKING)
  51. Active-runbook Playwright baseline-generation version matches the pin: the Playwright
      version named in total-check-runbook.md's baseline-generation instruction must equal the
      @playwright/test pin in package.json. Visual-regression baselines depend on the generating
      Playwright (Chromium) version, and the operational "generate the baseline with version X"
      instruction lives in the active runbook in prose — a different place from the pin — so a
      dependency bump can leave the runbook's version behind (this happened across the
      1.49.1→1.55.1→1.60.0 bumps, where the runbook kept saying 1.55.1 after the pin moved to
      1.60.0). A human following a stale runbook would generate the baseline with the wrong engine
      and produce spurious visual diffs against CI's pinned version. This extracts every concrete
      Playwright version the active runbook names and requires all of them to equal the pin
      (vacuously true if it names none, but the pin must be readable). Scope is the active runbook
      only: the decision records under docs/incident-artifacts/ are append-only history that
      legitimately preserve the version current at each increment and must NOT be rewritten, and
      repository-maintainability-map.md keeps the version-evolution narrative as a layer — only the
      single-source operational runbook is pinned. Same "surface a latent operational failure at
      pre-commit time" spirit as Check 48 (permission coupling) and Check 29 (baseline linkage). (BLOCKING)

    # knowledge-graph engine resolves the employment edge to a strong entity) only holds
    # if three facts in the first JSON-LD @graph agree:
    #   (a) the Person node has a worksFor,

    # Implementation note: the worksFor value may be EITHER a direct organization reference
    # ({"@id": "..."}) OR an OrganizationRole wrapper that nests the organization reference
    # one level down ({"@type": "OrganizationRole", "worksFor": {"@id": "..."}}). We resolve
    # the referenced @id through both shapes. Real JSON parsing (not regex) is used because
    # JSON-LD nesting is exactly what regex handles poorly. We only assert the linkage WHEN a
    # worksFor is present, so removing the employer entirely (a legitimate future state) does

    # ── 51. Active-runbook Playwright baseline-generation version matches the pin (BLOCKING) ──
    # Playwright の視覚回帰 baseline PNG は、それを生成した Playwright（＝同梱 Chromium）の
    # バージョンに依存する。CI（playwright-regression.yml / update-playwright-snapshots.yml）は
    # package-lock.json に固定された @playwright/test を `npm ci` で厳密復元して使うため、baseline は
    # 実質その pin バージョンで生成・比較される。ところが「baseline はどの版で生成すべきか」という
    # *運用指示* は active runbook（total-check-runbook.md §7.4）に自然言語で書かれており、pin
    # （package.json）とは別の場所にある。このため依存近代化で pin を bump したとき、runbook 側の
    # 版数記述だけが取り残されて *ドリフト* しうる。実際 1.49.1→1.55.1→1.60.0 と bump する過程で
    # runbook が「1.55.1 で生成」のまま残った履歴があり、これは人間が誤った版で baseline を生成し
    # CI（pin 版）との間に偽の視覚差分を生む運用事故クラスである。
    #
    # 本チェックは、active runbook が baseline 生成手順で名指しする具体 Playwright 版数（X.Y.Z）を
    # 一つ残らず抽出し、そのすべてが package.json の @playwright/test pin と一致することを BLOCKING で
    # 強制する。runbook が具体版数を一つも名指ししない場合は vacuous に成立する（ただし pin 自体が
    # 読めることは要求）。対象は active runbook のみ——decision 記録（docs/incident-artifacts/*）は
    # 「その increment 時点の事実」を残す append-only な歴史であり後発 bump で遡及修正しない（歴史を
    # 壊さない）ため対象外、repository-maintainability-map.md も版数進化（1.49.1→1.55.1→1.60.0）の
    # 物語を層として保持するため対象外とし、運用上 single-source となる runbook の指示だけを pin に
    # 拘束する。Check 48（baseline コミット経路の権限結合）/ Check 29（baseline 生成リンク）と同じ、
    # latent な運用事故を pre-commit で顕在化させる思想。
